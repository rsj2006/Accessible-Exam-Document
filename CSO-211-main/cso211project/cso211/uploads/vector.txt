1.
In C++, containers are typically implemented as class templates, so that the user can provide the desired element type as a template type argument.
2.
The Containers library is a part of the C++ standard library that contains various class types that implement some common types of containers. A class type that implements a container is sometimes called a container class. 
Only the class types in the Containers library are considered to be containers in C++

not considered to be containers by the C++ standard:

C-style arrays
std::string
std::vector<bool>
because std::string and std::vector<bool> implement most of the requirements, they behave like containers in most circumstances. As a result, they are sometimes called “pseudo-containers”.
